# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project creates a calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day . This app features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

* Displays current day at the top of the calender when a user opens the planner.
 
* Present timeblocks for standard business hours when the user scrolls down.
 
* Each timeblock is colour-coded based on past, present, and future time.
 
* The user can enter an event when they click a timeblock and click the save icon which stores the event in local storage.

* the app also allows the same event to persist between refreshes of a page.

## Usage
